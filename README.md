# ImageEmotionDetection
Emotion Detection via a Deep Learning Framework

Charity fundraising is increasingly relying on online platforms such as crowdfunding platforms. However, overwhelmingly, crowdfunding campaigns do not meet their goals. Therefore, it is imperative to examine how to improve the success of charity fundraising campaigns. In this paper, we focus on the design of project images on a crowdfunding website, which portray the themes and contents of the projects. Employing the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model, we investigate the relationships between image attributes (S) and image emotions (O), and between image emotions (O) and campaign outcomes (R). We develop and train a deep neural network model to identify the emotions conveyed in the images, and then implement it to project images from a popular crowdfunding platform. We apply the obtained image emotions together with the objective image attributes and the project outcome metrics to explore from a design perspective, what image attributes evoke the image emotions, and how image emotions are related to the success of charity fundraising projects. Our results confirm these relationships and further suggest that the roles of image emotions on the success vary with project characteristics such as the project budget and category. In addition, the image emotions of competing projects on the crowdfunding platform are found to reduce the projectâ€™s performance. In an extended study, we conduct an online randomized controlled experiment by manipulating image attributes to reexamine the causal relationships and verify the mediating roles of positive and negative empathies between image emotions and campaign outcomes. This research contributes to the charity fundraising literature from a novel perspective of emotions in project images. It presents new and unique findings regarding the mediation roles of positive and negative empathies, and the limitation of sadness emotions in certain types of charity fundraising. In addition, our findings provide useful insights for practitioners to design successful online charity campaigns.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/729885/181081760-0c90f758-f3cb-49ba-8d45-611f565581c6.png)
